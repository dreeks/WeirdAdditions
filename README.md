## How to use it ?
The first beta of the mod is available. Download it [here](https://github.com/dreeks/WeirdAdditions/releases).

You can find everything you need to learn about the mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/dreeks/WeirdAdditions/wiki).

There will soon be a website with everything related to the mod

## Why ?
We were playing on our own modpack when we got this stupid idea, planting fish & cows. So we decided to make it.

We also wanted to add other things we tried to do during the previous years of FeedTheBeasting but failed to at the moment.
